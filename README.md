# Challenge Summary
* Insert a value in the middle of a sorted array
* Strech goal: removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.

## Challenge Description
* Creat a function that pass a sorted array and a value and Insert tthe value in the middle of the array without using a build-in functions.
* Strech goal: creat a function that pass an array andremoves an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap without using a build-in functions.


## Approach & Efficiency
Writting two functions to reach the goals and testing them.
