# Linked List Implementation

## Challenge Summary
to create functions that mainapulate the linked list

## Challenge Description
creating three methods :
- insert(val): to add the value to the head of the linked list.
- includes(val) : to returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- toString(): to returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
use simple method to reach the goals of the challenge and testing them

## Solution
creating the methods and testing them by running npm run test in the terminal.


- [x] insert(val)
- [x] includes(val)
- [x] toString()
- [x] test methods
- [ ] streach goal
