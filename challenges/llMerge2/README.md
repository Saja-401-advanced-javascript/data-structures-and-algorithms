# Challenge Summary
to merge two linked list together so the nodes alternate between the two lists.

## Challenge Description
To write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. merge the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. 

## Approach & Efficiency
thinking of a method to write the function in a simple way then test it for validation

## Solution
using while() then if() in order to solve the challenge and using two linked list examples to test the function.

## Efficiency (Big O) 
- **mergeLists(list1, list2)** : o(n);
